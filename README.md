# Remember2

An in-memory data store backed by shared preferences, for Android.

This is a key-value store with some nice properties:

1. Speed. Everything is loaded into memory so reads can happen on the UI thread. Writes and deletes happen asynchronously (with callbacks). Every public method is safe to call from the UI thread.

2. Durability. Writes get persisted to disk, so that this store maintains state even if the app closes or is killed.

3. Consistency. Doing a write followed by a read should return the value you just put.

4. Thread-safety. Reads and writes can happen from anywhere without the need for external synchronization.

Note that since writes are asynchronous, an in-flight write may be lost if the app is killed before the data has been written to disk. If you require true 'commit' semantics then Remember is not for you.

## About Remember2

This is an update on top of mlapadula's Remember2 (https://github.com/mlapadula/remember2):

* Allow null but will skip the save
* If save value is the same as the one in memory, skip the save

Update from mlapadula's Remember2 from [original Remember library](https://github.com/tumblr/remember) with some extra features:
* Namespacing by file, so you can effectively have different "tables"
* Allowing you to store/retrieve JSON easily
* Allowing you to query the data store. (In the easiest, simplest way possible: iterate over the values and look for things that match a given function)
* Adds some missing methods
* Fails fast on null insert

Everything is still in-memory so it's fast and easy, but not appropriate for storing really large amounts of data.

Remember2 is backwards-compatible with the original Remember. Just create an instance of Remember2 that references the same shared preferences file.

## Download

Grab the artifact via JCenter. Include JCenter as a repository in your build.gradle file:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
```

And add Remember to your dependencies:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.allenchankl:remember:2.0.2'
}
```

## Usage

Obtain instances of Remember via `create()`:

```java
Remember myRemember = Remember.create(context, "some-shared-preferences-name");
```

This will create a new instance of Remember if you haven't used it before, or will use a shared instance if there's already one in existence.

Use Remember like so:

```java
myRemember.putString("some key", "some value");
String value = myRemember.getString("some key", "");
```

Chain multiple values and apply in a single editor.apply call:

```java
myRemember.build().putString("some key", "some value")
    .putFloat("some key", 12345L)
    .putInt("some key", 1000)
    .apply();
```

Replace apply to commit to save values in non-async way

```java
myRemember.build().putString("some key", "some value")
    .putFloat("some key", 12345L)
    .putInt("some key", 1000)
    .commit();
```

More examples are available in the [sample app](https://github.com/mlapadula/remember2/blob/master/sample-app/src/main/java/com/mlapadula/remembersample/RememberSample.java#L56)

## Sample app
Clone and build this repo in Android Studio to see an example of a sample app. The app simply increments a counter stored in Remember and tells you the value.
